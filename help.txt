I have trigger words. Certain words make me all triggered and I respond. I also have a 5% chance of randomly getting triggered, but you can relate, can't you fam?

I also have commands, which are the following:


`.fam help` - Displays this cancerous menu.

`.fam getinvite` - Gives the link to dad's cancerous server.

`.fam mock` - Literal cancer, and it should not exist, do not enter this command.

`.fam shutup <user name or id> <name>` - Says "shut up <name>" every time <user> says something.

`.fam say <number>` - Says one of my cancerous random responses of your choice.

`.fam suggest <suggestion>` - Sends the rest of your cancerous message to my dad as a suggestion for him to consider and probably never add because he's a lazy piece of shit.

`.fam fetchuser <userid>` - Fetches a user's info by their ID. Was a simple embed test my dad made.

`.fam e6rand` - Grabs a random image from <https://e621.net>. Fucking furry.


If you want to invite me to join your fam elsewhere, give your fam this link, fam.

If you need any help or have any cancerous suggestions, talk to dad, Metalloriff#2891, or use the suggest command.
